# HexVMT
The program is a math calculator that performs subtraction between two hexadecimal numbers. It outputs the result in hexadecimal format and the VMT index result, which is obtained by dividing the hexadecimal result by 4. The calculator also includes various features such as adding an "0x" prefix, toggling the result to uppercase or always on top, and the ability to copy the result or VMT index to the clipboard.

This program was designed to simplify the work of reverse engineers and make their life easier.
